# TVQA
PyTorch code accompanies the TVQA dataset paper, in EMNLP 2018

### Notice
I am working on cleaning and re-running the scripts to make sure everything matches the paper. It may take a while, please follow this repo for updates.


### TODO
1. [ ] Add data preprocessing scripts
2. [ ] Add baseline scripts
3. [ ] Add model and training scripts
